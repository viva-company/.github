## Using open source

To ensure that every project can be released openly and safely,  
we follow these steps:

 - Respect license obligations.
 - Register open source components before use.
 - Comply with distribution requirements, including generating NOTICE files and providing source code.

These practices help us build software that is open and sustainable.
